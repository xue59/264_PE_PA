In this exercise, you will implement two different array processing
functions. Your solution should be short: between 50 and 150 lines of
code, including lines used for spacing.

// ~ Learning Goals ~ //

You should learn:
(1) How to compile, run, and test your code.
(2) How to run your code under valgrind, in order to find memory,
and more generally, programming errors.
(3) How to "iterate" over arrays in C.
(4) How to use argc and argv correctly in main.

// ~ Getting Started ~ //

The PE01 folder contains five files:
(1) answer01.c: this is the file that you hand in. It has the skeleton
of two functions in it, and you must "fill in the blanks".
(2) answer01.h: this is a "header" file and it contains a complete
explanation of the functions you will be writing for this exercise.
(3) pe01.c: You should use this file to write testing code that
runs the functions in answer01.c, in order to ensure their
correctness. pe01.c comes with some example testing code to help you
get started.  Without arguments, your code should run in test mode, i.e,
simply the test functions in pe01.c.  With proper arguments, your code should 
call the correct functions written in answer01.c, and you are supposed to
write the code to parse the arguments.
(4) README: this file.
(5) inputfile: an input file for testing your main function.  It is 
a file that contains only numbers. 

To get started, read this README in its entirety. Browse through the 
answer01.h file, to see what code needs to be written. You will be 
writing code in the answer01.c file. You will also write code in the 
pe01.c file to test code written in the answer01.c file.  Moreover, 
you will write code in the main function to call the correct functions 
in answer01.c.  pe01.c contains the comments telling you the code that 
needs to be written in pe01.c. 

Follow the discussions below on how to compile and run your code, as
well as test and submit it.

// ~ Submitting Your Assignment ~ //

You must submit four files:
(1) answer01.c (7 points): largest_partial_sum function (3.5 points), 
largest_difference function (3.5 points)
(2) pe01.c: main function (3 points)
(3) memcheck.log.1, memcheck.log.2, two Valgrind log files
that you produced running your program. (2 points)

Use the following command to zip your files:

> zip PE01.zip answer01.c pe01.c memcheck.log.1 memcheck.log.2 

Submit PE01.zip through Blackboard.  You may submit as many
versions as you like.  We will grade only the final submission. 

// ~ (1a) Compiling Your Program ~ //

The remainder of this document is to help you figure out how to meet
the learning goals of this exercise. Firstly, you must compile, run
and test your program.

In this course we use the compiler "gcc", which is one of the world's
best and most important C compilers. You can compile your program by
typing the following into the terminal (make sure you are in your PE01
directory):

> gcc -Wall -Wshadow -Werror -g pe01.c answer01.c -o pe01

Gcc takes a wide variety of arguments, and these are the most
important arguments that we will use, and re-use in this course. The
arguments mean:
(1) -Wall, turn on all *common* compilation warnings. 
(2) -Wshadow, in addition to common warnings, warn if a variable
declaration "shadows" the declaration of another variable.
(3) -Werror, turn warnings into errors.  In other words, you won't 
get an executable when you have warnings.  Therefore, you have
to fix all warnings.
(3) -g, turn on debugging symbols. This produces a larger executable
program; however, you can use this program in a debugger.  You will
probably need to use a debugger for more complicated programs.
(4) pe01.c answer01.c. These are the files that you are compiling and
linking into a computer program. You compile only ".c" files. You
never compile ".h" files. Each ".c" file is compiled separately (gcc
does this internally), and multiple ".c" files are linked together
into a single computer program. Compiling and linking are two
different steps, but here we are doing both steps with a single
instruction. The "int main(...)" function must appear in precisely one
of those ".c" files (pe01.c). It cannot appear in answer01.c. 
(5) -o pe01, create an "output file" pe01. By default gcc will produce
a file called "a.out", and we are just telling gcc to name that file
"pe01" instead.

// ~ (1b) Running Your Program ~ //

To run your program, simply type into the terminal:

> ./pe01

Note that this should print:
Welcome to ECE264, we are working on PE01.

Testing largest_partial_sum(...)
{-4, -1, 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 21}. partial sum = 0, expected = 57. FAIL
{}. partial sum = 0, expected = 0.
{1, 4, -1, 6, -5, 4}. partial sum = 0, expected = 10. FAIL
{-1, -2, -3, -4}. partial sum = 0, expected = -1. FAIL

Testing largest_difference(...)

As the functions in answer01.c are incomplete, the test cases should fail
in many instances.  These statements are printed by "printf" statements in 
different functions in pe01.c. You can (and should) modify pe01.c, and edit its 
behavior, in order to test the behavior of the functions you are writing 
in "answer01.c".

The file (technically: compilation unit) pe01.c "knows" about the
functions in answer01.c, because it "includes" the declarations for
those functions, which are written in the file "answer01.h". 
Declarations are not compiled into code, but instead, they merely
describe the existence of some compilable function in some compilation
unit somewhere. In this case, the functions declared in answer01.h are
defined in the compilation unit "answer01.c".

// ~ (2) Running valgrind ~ //

Before you write anything to answer01.c and pe01.c,
compile the .c files into pe01 and run the following command:

> valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --log-file=memcheck.log.1 ./pe01 

Valgrind is an extremely useful tool for finding problems in C
programs. It is free-software, and (for C) as good as any software
commercially available. Comparable commercial software is usually
worth a few thousand dollars per user. (!).

It is a core goal of this course that you learn how to use Valgrind in
order to ensure that your exercises/assignments do not have memory or
programming errors.  Valgrind is an invaluable tool in an engineers toolbox 
to do what most people in society don't know how to do: ensure that something 
is correct.

Valgrind has many functions; however, in this course, we will concern
ourselves with the "memcheck" function. The memcheck function runs
your code in an emulated environment, and checks whether you access
any bits of memory that you shouldn't. Memcheck also tests to see if
you have allocated (asked for) memory that you never freed (gave
back). Together, these two types of memory problems are some of the
most pernicious programming problems in the world, and cost literally
billions of dollars each year. Valgrind will help you find these
problems.

The preceding command *runs* your program, but to check for errors, you must 
read the log file that you just generated: "memcheck.log.1". This file
contains a lot of information. If your solution has no memory errors,
then you will see at the end of the file something like:

   ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 2 from 2)

Don't worry about suppressed errors: they are not errors. When your
program runs, the C runtime (almost always) performs a few memory
tricks in order to execute more efficiently. Memcheck picks up these
advanced programming tricks, and then they are suppressed because it
is well-known that these tricks are not errors. Valgrind offers these
error suppression facilities because they are required by advanced
developers who work on important "glue" code that holds modern
operating systems together. In short: don't worry about suppressed
errors. Google is your friend if you are interested in more
information; however, it will not be tested in this course.

// ~ (2a) Debugging Valgrind Errors ~ //

If you have errors from valgrind, you should fix them.
Look for the *first* error, and debug that error. Sometimes you will
get hundreds (or even hundreds of thousands) or errors; however, they
may all caused by the same line of code. So just debug the first
problem you encounter in the "memcheck.log" file.

Most memory errors fall into one of four categories:
(2a.i) "Invalid read of size X", where X is a number. This means that
you are reading X bytes of memory that you do not have access to.
(2a.ii) "Invalid write of size X", as above, except that you are
*writing* memory. Writing means, that the memory access is on the
left-hand side of an "=" sign. (ie., assignment operation, eg. x = 5.)
(2a.iii) "X bytes in 1 blocks definitely lost in loss record U of V",
which means that you have asked for X bytes of memory, but never freed
them.
(2a.iv) "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)" A
conditional jump or move is what happens in an if statement or a for
loop, where some condition (e.g., if(x > 5) {...}) determines the next
line of code that is executed. If the memory is uninitialized (e.g.,
"x" has not been set), then the program behavior is random. When you
see this error, look at the involved statement and ask yourself how
any involved variables could be uninitialized.

These memory errors can be difficult to solve, but it is much easier
if you think precisely about your code. This is necessary skill, and
expect to spend much time over this semester learning to do just that.

// ~ (2b) Intentionally injecting an error ~ //

You would have to inject an error in pe01.c to generate
the other valgrind log file.  Take a look at the
at the following function in pe01.c

printArray(int * array, int len)

You change the iteration from "ind < len" to "ind <= len".
Now, you compile and run the valgrind to get memcheck.log.2

> valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --log-file=memcheck.log.2 ./pe01 

Take a look at the file memcheck.log.2.  Do you see the error messages?
Do the error messages somehow point you to the source of the error?
In particular, a subset of error messages may look like the following:

==18690== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
==18690==    at 0x4E8158E: vfprintf (vfprintf.c:1660)
==18690==    by 0x4E8B498: printf (printf.c:33)
==18690==    by 0x400975: printArray (pe01.c:22)
==18690==    by 0x400C36: test_largest_partial_sum (pe01.c:108)
==18690==    by 0x400D08: test_00_largest_partial_sum (pe01.c:128)
==18690==    by 0x400DD7: main (pe01.c:163)

Both printf and vfprintf are functions provided by the system and they 
are out of your control.  You should pay attention to the messages
that correspond to functions in your program.  In this case, you
should look at printArray in pe01.c at around line 22.  In other words,
valgrind actually tells you where the problems are.

Next, revert back to the original printArray function before you
start to write the functions largest_partial_sum and largest_difference
in answer01.c and the main function in pe01.c.

// ~ (2c) Submitting two Valgrind Log Files ~ //

In order to pass this exercise, you must submit the two log files produced
by valgrind. See the section on submitting your exercise (above) for
information on how to do that.

// ~ (3) Iterating Over Arrays in C ~ //

In programming, iterating means visiting every element of a
"collection" once, and only once. An array is the most fundamental
type of collection, having a fixed size, and storing the elements
sequentially. The easiest way to iterate over an array is to use an
"index" variable in a for-loop:

   // Assume we have an array "array", with length "len"
   int ind; // the index variable
   for(ind = 0; ind < len; ++ind) {
      // do something with array[ind]
   }

You should already be familiar with this programming motif from
earlier courses. Please refer to the class notes and course materials
in order to understand how to iterate over arrays in C.

Both functions largest_partial_sum and largest_difference require
you to iterate over an array to compute the largest partial sum and
the largest difference.

A array of length len has "len" partial sums.  The (i,j)-th partial
sum is the sum of array[i] through array[j], 0 <= i <= j < len. There
are a total of (len)(len+1)/2 partial sums:  (0,0)-th, ..., (0, len-1)-th,
(1,1)-th, ..., (1, len-1)-th, ..., (len-1,len-1)-th.  The 
function largest_partial_sum computes the largest among these
partial sums.  If the array is of length 0, the partial sum is
defined to be 0.

The function largest_difference finds the largest element and
the smallest element in any array and calculate their difference
(largest - smallest).  If the array is of length 0 or length 1, the
largest difference is defined to be 0.

These two functions are to be written in answer01.c.

// ~ (3a) Testing Your Program ~ //

It is your responsibility to test your program and ensure that it
works. A program that is correct 99% of the time is still non-functional.
It is very difficult to write programs correctly, and large programs almost 
always contain subtle bugs. For this reason, software engineers should
adopt a zero-tolerance policy for software defects. 

Please note that receiving a passing grade for a function/program
does not mean your exercise is perfect, but it does mean that your 
exercise passes the tests we thought to put it through. 

Testing your own program is a fundamental skill if you want to be
a programmer.  

So how do you write and test your code?

The most important thing to understand is that you should test your
code as you go. Because you are just starting, pe01.c includes a
little bit of testing code to start you off. However, in future
exercises/assignments, you will have to generate all of the testing code
yourself.

The sample testing routine provided is named test_00_largest_partial_sum().
You probably want to write test_01_largest_difference().

To write your own testing code, you have to *think* about the function your
developing, and then you have to write code that *demonstrates* that
it *always* works. This is a core skill to develop if you are
interested in being a competent computer programmer.

// ~ (4) Running Your Program with arguments ~ //

In pe01.c, you also have to fill in the main function with
correct statements so that you will get the following
screen output for when you type in different commands:

> ./pe01 0 inputfile
Welcome to ECE264, we are working on PE01.

{142, 44, 333, 33, 246, 40, -10, -204, 190}
838
> ./pe01 1 inputfile
Welcome to ECE264, we are working on PE01.

{142, 44, 333, 33, 246, 40, -10, -204, 190}
537
> ./pe01 193 inputfile
Welcome to ECE264, we are working on PE01.

{142, 44, 333, 33, 246, 40, -10, -204, 190}
0
> ./pe01 inputfile
Welcome to ECE264, we are working on PE01.

> ./pe01
Welcome to ECE264, we are working on PE01.

Testing largest_partial_sum(...)
{-4, -1, 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 21}. partial sum = 57, expected = 57.
{}. partial sum = 0, expected = 0.
{1, 4, -1, 6, -5, 4}. partial sum = 10, expected = 10.
{-1, -2, -3, -4}. partial sum = -1, expected = -1.

Testing largest_difference(...)

In the third to last command, the first
argument is invalid.  In the second to last command,
We are short of 1 argument.  If an invalid
filename is given, the array will be a NULL
array, and variable len will stay as 0.  
You should only worry about the handling of the
first argument correctly.  I have already
handle the second argument for you correctly.
You should also not have to write any "printf"
statement in the main function.  You are
allowed to write "printf" statement in
your test functions.  In the last command,
the test function test_00_largest_partial_sum 
and the incomplete test function test_01_largest_difference
is run.

You can also create a different file, inputfile_alt, for
example, and use that file in the commands.
 
// ~ (4a) Running ./pe01 Under Valgrind ~ //

You should also run ./pe01 with arguments under valgrind.
To do that, you have to use for example the following command:

> valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --log-file=memcheck.log ./pe01 1 inputfile

// ~ Warning ~ //

The only places for you put printf statement is in the test functions that
you may write.  The main function, as well as the two functions in answer01.c
should not have other printf statement added to the functions.  If your output
does not match our expected output because of additional printf statement you
have added, you will get 0 for that particular test case.  

The bottomline is that you should not be using printf to debug your program.

You are not submitting answer01.h.  Therefore, you should not make changes
to answer01.h.

You can declare and define additional functions that you have to use in
pe01.c and answer01.c. 

Grading of programming exercises and assignments is performed on
ecegrid.ecn.purdue.edu.  You should perform testing of your work
on ecegrid.ecn.purdue.edu before submission.  Correct output on
your computer does not translate into correct output on
ecegrid.ecn.purdue.edu.
